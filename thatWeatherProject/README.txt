Datasets:

Analyzing temperature changes across the globe over several centuries and building a deep learning-based time series model for forecasting U.S. average temperature requires access to reliable and comprehensive datasets. Here are some sources where you can find relevant datasets:

National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): The NCEI, managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), provides access to a wide range of climate and weather data. Their Climate Data Online (CDO) portal (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) offers historical climate data, including temperature records, from various sources.

NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS): GISS provides climate data sets and analysis tools. Their GISTEMP dataset (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) includes global surface temperature records from 1880 onwards.

Berkeley Earth: Berkeley Earth offers a comprehensive global temperature dataset derived from a combination of historical weather station records and other sources. Their data can be accessed through their website (http://berkeleyearth.org/).

European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D): ECA&D provides access to climate observations from meteorological stations across Europe. Their dataset (https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php) includes long-term temperature records that can be useful for regional analysis.

Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR): The CFSR dataset from NOAA provides global weather and climate reanalysis data. It covers a long historical period and includes temperature records at various spatial and temporal resolutions.

Please note that some of these datasets may require registration or have specific terms of use. It's important to review the documentation and comply with any licensing or usage requirements when accessing and using the data.

For building a multivariate deep learning-based time series model, you can preprocess the temperature data along with other relevant features like humidity, pressure, or precipitation. You may also consider incorporating external factors like greenhouse gas emissions or El Niño/La Niña events, depending on the specific research objectives. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch can be utilized for model development and training.

Remember to consider the limitations and assumptions associated with the datasets and models used for climate analysis and forecasting. It's also advisable to consult with domain experts or climate scientists to ensure the appropriate interpretation and utilization of the data.
