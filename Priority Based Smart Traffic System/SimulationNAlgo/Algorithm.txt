Algorithm

Obtain the current phase timing and duration of the cycle. This information can be obtained from the controller unit that controls the traffic signal.

Determine the desired phase timing that you want to change to. (This can be based on various factors such as traffic flow, pedestrian activity, and time of day.)

Calculate the difference between the current phase timing and the desired phase timing. 
This will give you the amount of time by which you need to shift the cycle phase.

Divide the shift time by the duration of the cycle to determine the number of cycles that need to be added or subtracted to reach the desired phase timing.

Adjust the cycle timing by adding or subtracting the required number of cycles to the current phase timing.

Validate the new phase timing to ensure that it falls within the limits of the traffic signal controller. 
(This is important to prevent incorrect signaling or damage to the controller.)

Update the traffic signal controller with the new phase timing.

Monitor the traffic flow to ensure that the new phase timing is providing the desired results. 
(If necessary, repeat the algorithm to make further adjustments to the phase timing.)


Implementation


Obtain the current phase timing and duration of the cycle: 
	To access the current phase timing and duration of the cycle for a traffic signal controller. 
	For example, you could use the getPhaseIndex() and getPhaseDuration() methods to retrieve this information.

Determine the desired phase timing: 
	Factors such as traffic flow, pedestrian activity, and time of day to determine the desired phase timing. 
	
Calculate the difference between the current phase timing and the desired phase timing: 
	Simple arithmetic to calculate the difference between the current phase timing and the desired phase timing.

Divide the shift time by the duration of the cycle: 
	The division operator to calculate the number of cycles that need to be added or subtracted to reach the desired phase timing.

Adjust the cycle timing: 
	The setPhaseDuration() method in the Traffic Library to adjust the cycle timing by adding or subtracting the required number of cycles to the current phase timing.

Validate the new phase timing: 
	Conditional statements to validate the new phase timing to ensure that it falls within the limits of the traffic signal controller.

Update the traffic signal controller: 
	The setPhaseDuration() method to update the traffic signal controller with the new phase timing.

Monitor the traffic flow: 
	AnyLogic's visualization tools to monitor the traffic flow and ensure that the new phase timing is providing the desired results. 
	If necessary, you can repeat the algorithm to make further adjustments to the phase timing. [AI]
