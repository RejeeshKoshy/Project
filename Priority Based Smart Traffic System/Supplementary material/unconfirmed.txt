Transit-signal priority (TSP), an existing similar system, is the most efficient technique of ensuring the speed of transit vehicles on an arterial road network. The majority of previous TSP research has focused on expanding the general-vehicle arterial signal-coordination model. Despite the existence of numerous excellent TSP models in the literature, TSP control has been rarely used in reality because to worries about its harmful effects on non-transit road users. As a result, progression models that benefit both general and transit vehicles are of great interest.

A person-capacity-based optimization method based on a binary mixed-integer linear programme was developed to improve the efficiency of transit-signal operation in terms of progression control. This model can be used to generate optimal lane markings, exclusive bus lanes, and TSP signal timings for isolated junctions; however, as a transit vehicle goes along the arterial route, it imposes a spatial limit. TRAMBAND, which can use MAXBAND to find the maximum general-vehicle bandwidth for a fixed tram bandwidth along the arterial. However, the MAXBAND model with identical bandwidths at multiple sections reduces the efficiency of green-time utilisation. TRAMBAND, which makes advantage of AM-BAND to make better use of green time. It described the BUS-MULTIBAND and BUS-AM-BAND solutions for simultaneously solving the signal-coordination problem for passenger auto mobiles and public-transport vehicles. By limiting the minimum bandwidth, it addressed the opposing demands of transit and general vehicles. TSP classified the main street intersections based on bus stop locations and optimised signal coordination to account for bus speed and dwell time. To improve the passive control technique under dwell-time uncertainty, bus-based signal coordination was developed, which takes into consideration the average dwell duration and its variance on arterial routes with high bus traffic. STEP BAND is a progression-control-based TSP that uses a uniform arrival distribution. STEP BAND allows for continuous bus movement and reduces waits for general traffic on the main road.


The Priority Based Smart Traffic System (PBSTS) targets intersections and exisiting traffic systems in particularly Bangalore. The system is evaluated based on arrival time, priority, and location. When registered emergency vehicles are needed in an area of trouble, a Radar Signal transmitter is erected to ping on a regular basis. The RADAR receivers at the nearest traffic light actively seek the source location and time of ping from the transmitter source, which provides the unique identifier of the registered emergency vehicle.If the algorithm detects an approaching emergency vehicle, the traffic signal cycle is paused to prioritise traffic flow for the emergency vehicle. To ensure complete transit in the lane, the algorithm actively monitors for periodic pings. The traffic light cycle is resumed once the emergency vehicle has completed its transit.
The emergency vehicle is registered via a website and an application. After completing the registration for the emergency vehicle, the priority allocation and RADAR transmitter are fitted and operational.
